This task is to help you prepare for your upcoming hackathon.
This is the development workspace you will be using during the hackathon and we'd like you to take some time now to familiarise yourself and get it ready.

**Note** 
* The editor is where you can do things such as write code, run a terminal session, and change IDE settings. 
* Each instance of an open file, terminal session, and so on is represented by a tab. 
* Tabs can be grouped into panes. 
* To open a new tab, choose the + icon at the edge of the row of tabs. 
* You can drag the tabs at the bottom to join the bigger pane.

If this is your first time using the c9 IDE, we suggest that you take the IDE tutorial/tour here: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_ac9_ide#tutorial-terminal

You can also view the user guide here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/ide.html.

## Hackathon practice task for developers (OPTIONAL)

**In your preferred language please write a program to do the following:**
1. Read in a single line containing 1..N numbers k[i] separated by spaces.
    You may assume (1 <= N <= 100) and (0 <= k[i] <= 1000)
2. Print out the following values:
  * Lowest value
  * Highest value
  * Average value
  * Difference between first and last values

**Example:**
Input: 104.45 108.89 99.56 102.3
Output: Low 99.56, High 108.89, Average 103.8, Diff -2.15

**Instructions**
1. To open a new terminal, click the + button on the tab panel above.
2. Code in your preferred language and install whatever you require to develop, compile, and run. *You have sudo rights on this machine.* Help for setting up many of the major languages can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/samples.html
3. If you have difficulties that you are unable to resolve on your own please email us. The chat window is not being actively monitored.
